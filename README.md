# Simpl Ops Portfolio Demo

Simpl Ops is an operational intelligence platform for service businesses. It detects operational bottlenecks, prioritizes what to fix first, and shows owner-facing recommendations through a dashboard and event-driven workflow model.

This public repo is a sanitized portfolio version. It does not include production credentials, live Google Sheets, webhook URLs, customer data, or private business logic.
